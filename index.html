    <h1>Hi, I'm Zach Allen!</h1>

    <p>I'm learning the basics of HTML and CS for web development. Please check back
    as I develop my skill and build this site!</p>

    <p>
      In the meantime, I'm currently working on the following open-source projects:
        <a href="https://github.com/ZJAllen/AR2" target="blank">
          AR2 Robot
        </a>
      (fork) and
        <a href="" target="blank">
          ShushEngine
        </a>
      , which is a simple-to-use stepper motor driver which doesn't require much CPU power.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is based on Roboteurs' SlushEngine project.  You can check them
      out at their
        <a href="https://roboteurs.com/" target="blank">
          website
        </a>
      or their
        <a href="https://github.com/Roboteurs/slushengine" target="blank">
          GitHub repo
        </a>
